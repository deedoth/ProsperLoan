# (Prosper Loan)
## by (Damilare Ayoola)


## Prosper Laon Data set

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, but I've reduced it to 13 variables, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that higher percentage of poeple that opted for the loan signed up 
36months Term. Probably becuase it give them enough time to repay back as much as it also increases 
the interest rate.I also find out that year 2013 was the peak year for Prosper. They gave out more 
loan out that year, but the shocking thing is that, after that year, the loan they gave out dropped 
drastically. That must be because of the high numbers of loan that were given out in the previous year, 
and they're yet to recover them because higher percentage of them signed up for 36 - 60 months Term.

Again I also discovered that ProsperScore (Risk) has no skew. It shows that the risk taken was balance.


## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I focused on the critaria by which Prosper give loans.
I started by checking the distribution of 'Employment Status' & 'Income Stats'.
My findings shows that Prosper gave higher percentage of Loan to Employed and Full-time
category. After checking further, I realized that these category are part of the highest
paid category.
It also shows that Prosper gave more loans to people that earns from $25k and above.

In summary, if you fall into 'Employed' or 'Full-time' Employment category, and you earn
from $25k upward, if you apply for loan from Prosper, your percentage of getting loan is
very high.
